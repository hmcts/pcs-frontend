# User Story

**AS A** Frontend Engineer  
**I WANT TO** implement NestJS as an abstraction layer above ExpressJS  
**SO THAT** we have guard rails (structure, standards, and reusable patterns) for ongoing frontend-related backend/API development.

## Context

Matt H proposed adopting NestJS to sit on top of our existing ExpressJS application to provide a more opinionated framework (modules, controllers, dependency injection, testing patterns), reducing inconsistency and improving maintainability. This ticket covers introducing NestJS in a way that preserves the underlying Express runtime while adding NestJS structure and conventions.

## Outcome

NestJS is running as the primary application framework, using Express as the HTTP adapter, with a minimal but working vertical slice of the current API migrated or wrapped.

## Deliverables

### 1. NestJS bootstrapped over Express
- Nest application created and configured to run with the Express adapter (i.e., still Express under the hood)
- Local dev run instructions updated
- Baseline structure + guard rails

### 2. Standard module layout
- AppModule, feature modules
- Controllers/services pattern in place
- Centralised configuration approach (env/config module)
- Standard error handling + validation approach (e.g., global pipes/filters)
- Interoperability with existing Express
- One working "vertical slice" implemented

### 3. Working vertical slice
- At least one representative existing endpoint/route group migrated into Nest (controller + service) or wrapped cleanly
- Includes request validation and consistent response shape (where applicable)
- Testing + quality gates

### 4. Documentation
- Short README section describing:
  - How to run the service
  - How to add a new endpoint using Nest conventions
  - Migration guidance (how to move Express routes into Nest modules incrementally)
